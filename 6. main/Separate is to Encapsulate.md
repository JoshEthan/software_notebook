Encapsulation is the act of hiding, limiting, separating, or protecting parts of your code. It's mostly associated with the wording of hiding or separating. 

As in my code over here and that code over there. The "other" code isn't supposed to know what the main code has and what it entails. 

It should just see some sort of interface a entry point. That's all. It doesn't see all of the behavior or different variables. Just 1 thing.
