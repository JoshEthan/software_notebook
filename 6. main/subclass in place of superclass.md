The Principle of Polymorphism is that our subclasses can be used in place of a superclass. 

[[Inheritance & Polymorphism#Polymorphism lets us use subclasses in place of superclasses|Polymorphism lets us use subclasses in place of superclasses]]

[[Inheritance & Polymorphism#superclass foo = superclass OR subclass bar|superclass foo = superclass OR subclass bar]]

[[Inheritance & Polymorphism#Polymorphism is using a subclass in place of a superclass|Polymorphism is using a subclass in place of a superclass]]
