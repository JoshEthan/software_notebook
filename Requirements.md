"It's a [[Singular Need|specific thing]] your [[System or Software System|system]] has to do to work correctly. A requirement is usually a [[Singular Need|single thing]], and you can **test** that thing to make sure you've actually fulfilled the requirement. A requirement is a [[singular need]] detailing what a particular [[product]] or [[service]] should **be** or **do**. It is most commonly used in a formal sense in [[systems engineering]] or [[software engineering]]" (McLaughlin, 2007, p. 62).


What does it mean to be testable?

Requirement is something your system has to do.
Requirement is something you can test.
Is a single detail of a product or service.







"In engineering, a **requirement** is a condition that must be satisfied for the output of a work effort to be acceptable. It is an explicit, objective, clear and often quantitative description of a condition to be satisfied by a [[material]], [[design]], [[product]], or [[service]]" ("Requirement," 2025, para. 1).

"Requirement is a relatively broad concept that can describe any necessary or desired function, attribute, capability, characteristic, or quality of a [[System or Software System|system]] for it to have value and utility to a customer, organization, user, or other stakeholder" ("Requirement," 2025, para. 5).



My Definition:
A singular testable condition your system must fulfill.

Questions:
How do you know if its a specific thing or generic thing?
How do you determine if you condition is singular or plural?



                         








"Something required; something wanted or needed: necessity; something essential to the existence or occurrence of something else: condition" (Merriam-Webster, 2025, para. 1).

>_IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology_ defines a requirement as:
>1. A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
>2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.
>3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2) 
(IEEE, 1983).

"Software Requirements for a [[System or Software System|system]] are the description of what the [[System or Software System|system]]  should do, the [[service]] or services that it provides and the constraints on its operation" ("Software Requirement," 2025, para. 1).

"Software requirements are detailed descriptions of the features, functionalities, and constraints of a [[System or Software System|software system]]" (Modern Requirements, 2025, para. 1).

"The software requirements are description of features and functionalities of the target [[System or Software System|system]]" (Tutorialspoint, 2025, para. 1).
