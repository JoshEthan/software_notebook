[[UML and Class Diagrams#UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a way to explain the need to know parts about the code and applications structure]]

1. UML let's you represent details about the classes in your app including name, variables, methods. This makes it really easy to see the big picture. You can tell what a class does at a glance. To make it slimmer, you can just have the name.
2. Use a class diagram to show what a class does at a glance by showing its name and optionally its variables and methods.
3. Use a Class Diagram to quickly show what a class does. Optionally omit its variables and methods.
