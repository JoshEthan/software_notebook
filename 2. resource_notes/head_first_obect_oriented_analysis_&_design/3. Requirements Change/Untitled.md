"The customer is always right.-- Even when requirements change, you've got to be ready to update your application and make sure it works like your customers expect. When your customer has a new need, it's up to you to change your applications to meet those new needs."  (pg. 114)

"The one constant in software analysis and design is change." (pg. 115)

"No matter how well you design an application, over time the application will always grow and change. You'll discover new solutions to problems, programming languages evolve, or your friendly customers will come up with crazy new requirements that force you to 'fix' working applications." (pg. 115)

"Requirements change all the time... sometimes in the middle of a project and sometimes when you think everything is complete." (pg. 115)

"Requirements always change. If you've got good use cases, though, you can usually change your software quickly to adjust to those new requirements." (pg. 115)

"Even the alternate steps now have alternate steps. These are listed as sub steps, but they really are providing a completely different path through the use case. These sub-steps provides an additional set of steps that can be followed, but these sub-steps are really a different way to work through the use case." (pg. 120)

"Use cases have to make sense to you.-- If a use case is confusing to you, you can simply rewrite it. There are tons of different ways that people write use cases, but the important thing is that it makes sense to you, your team, and the people you have to explain to."

"Now we've added a label to tell us that these steps on the left are part of the main path. We've moved the steps that can occur instead of the steps on the main path over here to the right. When there's only a single step, we'll always use that step when we go through the use case. These sub-steps are optional... you may use them, but you don't have to. But they're still on the left because they don't replace steps on the main path. You can only take one step to work through the use case: either the step on the left, OR the step on the right. No matter how you work through this use case, you'll always end up at step 8 on the main path."  (pg. 122)

"Following the arrows give you a particular path through the use case. A path like this is called a scenario. There are usually several possible scenarios in a single use case."  (pg. 124)

"An alternate path is one or more steps that a use case has that are optional, or provide alternate ways to work through the use case. Alternate paths can be additional steps added to the main path, or provide steps that allow you to get to the goal in a totally different way than parts of the main path." (pg. 125)

"When you have two different paths through part of a use case that is actually just another kind of alternate path. The system is designed for one or the other not both." (pg. 125)

"You can have more than one alternate path in the same use case. You can have alternate paths that provide additional steps, and multiple ways to get from the starting condition to the ending condition. You can even have an alternate path that ends the use case early." (pg. 125)

"A complete path through a use case, from the first step to the last, is called a scenario." (pg. 125)

"Most use cases have several different scenarios, but they always share the same user goal." (pg. 125)

"Now that our use case is finished up, and we've figured out all the possible scenarios for using the system, we're ready to write code to handle the customers new requirements." (pg. 129)

"Any time you change your use case, you need to go back and check your requirements.-- Remember, the whole point of a good use case is to get good requirements. If your use case changes, that may mean that your requirements change, too. Let's review the requirements and see if we need to add anything to them." (pg. 129)

"Go ahead and write in any additional requirements that you've discovered working through the scenarios." (pg. 129)

"So we need to handle the two new alternate paths by adding a couple extra requirements to our requirements list. We've gone ahead and crossed off the steps that our requirements already handle, and it looks like we need a few additions to our requirements list." (pg. 130)

"With new requirements comes new code." (pg. 131)

"Duplicate code is a bad idea." (pg. 138)

"Even though this is a design decision, it's part of getting the software to work like the customer wants it to. Remember, it's OK to use good design as you're working on your system's functionality." (pg. 138)

"Sometimes a change in requirements reveals problems with your system that you didn't even know were there." (pg. 141)

"Change is constant, and your system should always improve every time you work on it." (pg. 141)

"Your requirements will always change (and grow) over time." (pg. 142)

"Encapsulate what varies." (pg. 142)

"Requirements will always change as a project progresses." (pg. 142)

"When requirements change, your system has to evolve to handle the new requirements." (pg. 142)

"When your system needs to work in a new or different way, begin by updating your use case." (pg. 142)

"A scenario is a single path through a use case, from start to finish." (pg. 142)

"A single use case can have multiple scenarios, as long as each scenario has the same customer goal." (pg. 142)

"Alternate paths can be steps that occur only some of the time, or provide completely different paths through parts of a use case." (pg. 142)

"If a step is optional in how a system works, or a step provides an alternate path through a system, use numbered sub steps like 3.1, 4.1, and 5.1, or 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and 2.3.1." (pg. 142)

"You should almost always try to avoid duplicate code. It's a maintenance nightmare, and usually points to problems in how you've designed your system." (pg. 142)
