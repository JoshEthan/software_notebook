## UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a way to explain the need to know parts about the code and applications structure
"So we'll be using UML, the ***Unified Modeling Language***, which is a language used to communicate just the **details** about your **code** and **application's structure** that other developers and customers **need**, without getting details that aren't necessary." (pg. 577)

## Use a Class Diagram to quickly show what a class does. Optionally omit its variables and methods.
"This is how you show a class in a class diagram. That's the way that UML lets you represent details about the classes in your application. This is the name of the class. It's always in bold, at the top of the class diagram. These are the member variables of the class. Each one has a name, and then a type after the colon. The line separates the member variables from the methods of the class. These are the methods of the class. Each one has a name, and then any parameters the method takes, and then a return type after the colon. A class diagram makes it really easy to see the big picture; you can easily tell what a class does at a glance. You can even leave out the variables and/or methods if that helps you communicate better." (pg. 577)

## Class Diagrams optionally have Access Modifiers and Constructors. Class Diagrams don't explain what methods do. 
"Class diagrams can provide information about public, private, or protected, but in most cases, it's not needed for clear communication. There was nothing about a constructor in the class diagram. You could written a constructor that took in a value, and that would be OK, too. The class diagram didn't tell us what this method did... we made some assumptions, but we can't be sure if this code is really what was intended." (pg. 578)

## Class Diagrams explain only basic details about variables and methods
"The class diagram isn't a very complete representation of a class. It's not meant to be. Class diagrams are just a way to communicate the basic details of a class's variables and methods. it also makes it easy to talk about code without forcing you to wade through hundreds of lines..." (pg. 578)

## Use UML as a consistent diagram language. 
"By using a standard like UML, we can all speak the same language and be sure we're talking about the same thing in our diagrams." (pg. 578)

## There are many UML diagrams.
"UML is actually a lot more than a class diagram. UML has diagrams for the state of your objects, the sequence of events in you application, and it even has a way to represent customer requirements and interactions with your system. And there's a lot more to learn about class diagrams, too." (pg. 578)


"UML stands for the Unified Modeling Language." (pg. 586)

"UML helps you communicate the structure of your application to other developers, customers, and managers." (pg. 586)

## Class Diagrams provide an overview of a class, including methods and variables
"A class diagram gives you an overview of your class, including its methods and variables." (pg. 586)
