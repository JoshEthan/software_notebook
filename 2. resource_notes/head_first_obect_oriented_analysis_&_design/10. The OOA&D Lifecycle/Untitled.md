"Feature List: Figure out what your app is supposed to do at a high level." (pg. 484)

"Use Case Diagrams: Nail down the big processes that your app performs, and any external forces that are involved." (pg. 484)

"Break Up the Problem: Break your application up into modules of functionality, and then decide on an order in which to tackle each of your modules." (pg. 484)

"Requirements: Figure out the individual requirements for each module, and make sure those fit in with the big picture." (pg. 484)

"Domain Analysis: Figure out how your use cases map to objects in your app, and make sure your customer is on the same page as you are." (pg. 485)

"Preliminary Design: Fill in details about your objects, define relationships between the objects, and apply principles and patterns." (pg. 485)

"Implementation: Write code, test it, and make sure it works. Do this for each behavior, each feature, each use case, each problem, until you're done." (pg. 485)

"Delivery: You're done! Release your software, submit your invoices, and get paid." (pg. 485)

"You'll spend most of your development time in the design and implementation phases." (pg. 485)

"Features and requirements are often used almost interchangeably. Most of the time though people say 'feature' when they're talking about BIG things that an application needs to do. So it might take several requirements to satisfy one feature. And since features are usually a little bigger-picture than requirements, it's a good idea to start any new project by writing out a feature list, like we've done with the RouteFinder." (pg. 494)

"The feature list isn't just a list of hard problems you have to solve- it's a list of all the things your application has to be able to do. So even if a feature seems easy or trivial, put it on your feature list anyway." (pg. 494)

"With a feature list in hand, you should have a good understanding of the things that your app needs to do. You probably even can begin to think about the structure of your application, although we'll spend a lot more time on that in just a bit." (pg. 495)

"Once you've got your feature list down, you should move on to use case diagrams. Those will help you connect what you app does to how it will be used- and that's what customers really are interested in." (pg. 495)

"Your feature lists are all about understanding what your software is supposed to do." (pg. 495)

"Your case diagrams let you start thinking about how your software will be used, without getting into a bunch of unnecessary details." (pg. 495)
