## Encapsulation is the act of hiding, limiting, or protecting you data from being misused.
"Encapsulation is when you **hide** parts of your **data** from the rest of your application, and **limit** the ability for other parts of your code to access that data. Encapsulation is when you **protect information** in your code from **being used incorrectly**." (pg. 582)

##  Encapsulation, information hiding, or separation of concerns, puts elements into abstracted entities.
"Encapsulation does more than just hide information; it makes sure the methods you write to work with your data are actually used! The process of enclosing elements inside larger, more abstract entities. Also known as information hiding, or separation of concerns." (pg. 584)

## Use methods to responsibly update private variables.
"Encapsulation is not all about making all your variables private. Encapsulation is about separating information from other parts of your application that shouldn't mess with that information. With member variables you don't want the rest of your app directly messing with your data, so you separate that data by making it private. If the data needs to be updated, you can provide methods that work with the data responsibly. " (pg. 585)

## You can also encapsulate a group of properties so they don't get misused. 
"There are other ways to use encapsulation besides with variables. You can encapsulate a group of properties away from an object, and make sure that the object doesn't use those properties incorrectly. Even though we'll deal with an entire set of properties, it's still just separating a set of information away from the rest of your application."

## Encapsulation can also separate behavior from others parts of your code.
"Encapsulation is more than just protecting your data. Encapsulation can also help you separate behavior from other parts of your application. So you might put lots of code in a method, and put that method in a class; you've separated that behavior from the rest of your application, and the app has to use your new class and method to access that behavior. It's the same principles as with data, though: you're separating out parts of your application to protect them from being used improperly."

## Encapsulation controls separated data and behavior.
"Encapsulation separates your data from your app's behavior. Then you can control how each part is used by the rest of your application."

## Encapsulation is when you separate or hide part of your code from the rest of the code.
"Encapsulation is when you separate or hide one part of your code from the rest of your code." (pg. 586)

## The simplest form is when you make variables private, and only expose them via methods.
"The simplest form of encapsulation is when you make the variables of your classes private, and only expose that data through methods on the class." (pg. 586)

## You can encapsulate groups of data or behavior to control how they are used.
"You can also encapsulate groups of data, or even behavior, to control how they are accessed." (pg. 586)
