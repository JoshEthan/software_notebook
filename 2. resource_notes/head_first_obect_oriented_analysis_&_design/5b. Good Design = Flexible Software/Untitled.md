"Class are really about behavior!" (pg. 241)

"Because it seemed to make sense at the time, and it's HARD to change something you thought was already working!"  (pg. 246)

"Code once, look twice (or more!)-- Keep looking over your designs when you run into problems. A decision you made earlier may be what's causing you headaches now." (pg. 246)

"It's easy to rip apart someone else's code, but you've got to learn to look at your own code, and identify problems. This is where peer review, having fellow programmers look at your code, can really be a lifesaver." (pg. 246)

"Don't worry if you have to make changes; a better designed application will save you tons of time in the long run." (pg. 246)

"Design is iterative... and you have to be willing to change your own designs, as well as those that you inherit from other programmers." (pg. 246)

"Pride kills good design-- Never be afraid to examine your own design decisions, and improve on them, even if it means backtracking." (pg. 246)

"By encapsulating what varies, you make your application more flexible, and easier to change." (pg. 249)

"We decided that using a Map would be a great way to handle various types of properties, and still be able to easily add new properties at any time. Now we just have one member variable, a Map to store all properties. We can get rid of all these properties (and the related methods), and just use the properties map for everything." (pg. 250)

"When you have a set of properties that vary across your objects, use a collection, like a Map, to store those properties dynamically." (pg. 251)

"You'll remove lots of methods from your classes, and avoid having to change your code when new properties are added to your app." (pg. 251)

"Remember, one of the key principles in any OO design is to encapsulate what varies." (pg. 255)

"The best way to get good at software design is to write software!" (pg. 255)

"Most good designs come about through bad designs; almost nobody gets it all right the first time. So just do what makes sense, and then start applying your OO principles and patterns to see if you can make improvements to what you've got." (pg. 255)

"Most good designs come from analysis of bad designs." (pg. 255)

"Never be afraid to make mistakes and then change things around." (pg. 255)

"A cohesive class does one thing really well and does not try to do or be something else.-- The more cohesive your classes are, the high the cohesion of your software. Cohesive classes are focused on specific tasks. Look through the methods of your classes- do they all relate to the name of your class? If you have a method that looks out of place, it might belong on another class." (pg. 269)

"Cohesion measures the degree of connectivity among the elements of a single module, class, or object. The higher the cohesion of your software is, the more well-defined and related the responsibilities of each individual class in your application. Each class has a very specific set of closely related actions it performs." (pg. 269)

"Cohesion is really just a measure of how closely related the functionality of the classes in an application are. If one class is made up of functionality that's all related, then it has only one reason to change." (pg. 270)

"Cohesion focuses on how you've constructed each individual class, object, and package of your software. If each class does just a few things that are all grouped together, then it's probably a highly cohesive piece of software. But if you have on class doing all sorts of things that aren't closely related, you've probably got low cohesion." (pg. 271)

"Highly cohesive software is loosely coupled. In almost every situation, the more cohesive your software is, the looser the coupling between classes." (pg. 271)

"When you fundamentally change what an application does you may have to make lots of changes to a design that's already cohesive and loosely coupled. So cohesion isn't always a test of how easy it is to change software: but in cases where you're not dramatically changing how software works, highly cohesive software is usually easy to change." (pg. 271)

"High cohesion is better than low cohesion. Good OO design is when each class and module in your software does one basic thing, and that one thing really well. As soon as one class starts doing two or three different things, you're probably moving away from cohesion, and good OO design." (pg. 271)

"Software that's cohesive is easier to reuse and change. High cohesion and loose coupling adds up to software that can easily be extended, or even broken up and reused, because all the objects in the software aren't interdependent." (pg. 271)

"Think about it this way: the higher the cohesion in your application, the better defined each object's job is. And the better defined an object (and its job) is, the easier it is to pull that object out of one context, and have the object do the same job in another context. The object is happy to just keep on doing its very specific job, no matter where it's being used." (pg. 271)

"This is your goal... software that's getting more cohesive throughout the design life cycle." (pg. 273)

"Each time you make changes to your software, try and make sure you're getting more cohesive." (pg. 273)

"Great software is usually being good enough.-- It's hard to know when to stop designing software. Sure, you can make sure that your software does what it's supposed to do, and then start working on increasing the flexibility and cohesion of your code. But then what?" (pg. 274)

"Sometimes you just have to stop designing because you run out of time... or money... and sometimes you just have to recognize you've done a good enough job to move on." (pg. 274)

"If your software works, the customer is happy, and you've done your best to make sure things are designed well, then it just might be time to move on to the next project. Spending hours trying to write "perfect software" is a waste of time; spending lots of time writing great software and then moving on, is sure to win you more work, big promotions, and loads of cash and accolades. (pg. 274)

"Before you ever leave a project, you always want to make sure you software does what it's supposed to do." (pg. 275)

"Once you've got functionality down, move on to making good design decisions, using solid OO principles to add flexibility." (pg. 275)

"If you've done both of these things, it may just be time to move on... to the next project." (pg. 275)

"Well-designed software is easy to change and extend." (pg. 276)

"Use basic OO principles like encapsulation and inheritance to make your software more flexible." (pg. 276)

"If a design isn't flexible, then CHANGE IT! Never settle on bad design, even if it's your bad design that has to change." (pg. 276)

"Make sure each of your classes is cohesive: each of your classes should focus on doing ONE THING really well." (pg. 276)

"Always strive for higher cohesion as you move through your software's design life cycle." (pg. 276)

"The goal of good design is highly cohesive, loosely coupled software." (pg. 276)

"Classes are about behavior and functionality." (pg. 276)
