" Plan:
1. Gather requirements.
2. Figure out what the system should really do.
3. Get any additional information we need from the customer.
4. Build the system RIGHT!-- We're paying a lot more attention to Step 1 in writing great software this time, aren't we?-- 1. Make sure your software does what the customer wants it to do." (pg. 61)

"A requirements is a specific thing your system has to do to work correctly.-- A requirement is usually a single thing, and you can test that thing to make sure you've actually fulfilled the requirement. 'system' is the complete app or project you're working on. Remember, the customer decides when a system works correctly. So if you leave out a requirement, or even if they forget to mention something to you, the system isn't working correctly!" (pg. 62)

"A requirement is a singular need detailing what a particular product or service should be or do. It is most commonly used in a formal sense in systems engineering or software engineering." (pg. 62)

"When it comes to requirements, the best thing you can do is let the customer talk. And pay attention to what the system needs to do; you can figure out how the system will do those things later." (pg. 63)

"Don't worry about your code at this stage- just make sure you know what the system should do." (pg. 63)

"Requirements list is just a list of the things that your customer wants the system you're building them to do. Be sure to leave extra space... additional requirements almost always come up as you work on a project." (pg. 64)

"You need to understand how the system will be used.-- You've figured out one of the hardest parts about getting a customer's requirements- sometimes even the customer doesn't know what they really want! So you've got to ask the customer questions to figure out what they want before you can determine exactly what the system should do. Then, you can begin to think beyond what your customers asked for and anticipate their needs, even before they realize they have a problem." (pg. 65)

"This is a new list, which details what the system actually does. We can use these steps to see if we're missing any requirements." (pg. 66)

"A requirement is a lot more than just what the customer wants- that's a good place to start. Begin by finding out what your customer wants and expects, and what they think the system you're building for them should do. But there's still a lot more to think about..." (pg. 67)

"Remember, most people expect things to work even if problems occur. So you've got to anticipate what might go wrong, and add requirements to take care of those problems as well. A good set of requirements goes beyond just what your customers tell you, and makes sure that the system works, even in unusual or unexpected circumstances." (pg. 67)

"The system is everything needed to meet a customer's goals. Even though customers are part of the system, they are all things you have to at least think about when designing the system." (pg. 67)

"You've got to make sure your app works like the customer wants it to- even if that's not how you would use the application. That means you've got to really understand what the system has to do, and how your customers are going to use it." (pg. 67)

"The only way to ensure you get the customer a working, successful system is to know the system even better than they do, and to understand exactly what it needs to do. You can then anticipate problems, and hopefully solve them before the customers ever know something could have gone wrong." (pg. 67)

"I should just come up with all sorts of bad things that might happen when the customer uses the system." (pg. 67)

"The best way to get good requirements is to understand what a system is supposed to do." (pg. 67)

"We can use these 'sub-numbers' to show some sub-steps that might happen. These extra steps are called alternate path." (pg. 70)

"You've been writing use cases all along.-- When you wrote down the steps you were writing a use case. A use case is what people call the steps that a system takes to make something happen." (pg. 71)

"A use case describes what your system does to accomplish a particular customer goal.-- Use cases are all about the 'what'. Remember, don't worry about the 'how' right now... we'll get to that a little bit later." (pg. 72)

"We're still definitely focusing on what the system needs to 'do'." (pg. 72)

"A single use case focuses on a single goal." (pg. 72)

"The customer goal is the point of the use case: what do all these steps need to make happen? We're focusing on the customer, remember? The system has to help that customer accomplish their goal." (pg. 72)

"The user (or users) are outside of the system, not part of it." (pg. 72)

"The entire use case describes exactly what X does when Y happens." (pg. 73)

"The use case ends when the customer goal is complete." (pg. 73)

"This is an alternate path, but it's still about achieving the same goal as the main path, so it's part of the same use case." (pg. 73)

"A use case is a technique for capturing the potential requirements of a new system or software change. Each use case provides one or more scenarios that convey how the system should interact with the end user or another system to achieve a specific goal." (pg. 73)

"There are three basic parts to a good use case, and you need all three if your use case is going to get the job done." (pg. 74)

"
1. Clear Value-- Every use case must have a clear value to the system. If the use case doesn't help the customer achieve their goal, then the use case isn't of much use.
2. Start and Stop-- Every use case must have a definite starting and stopping point. Something must begin the process, and then there must be a condition that indicates that the process is complete.
3. External Initiator-- Every use case is started off by an external initiator, outside of the system. Sometimes that initiator is a person, but it could be anything outside of the system." (pg. 74)

"In most cases, a use case is just a list of the steps that a system has to do to work correctly. But, remember, one of the key points about a use case is that it is focused on accomplishing one particular goal. If your system does more than one thing then you'll need more than one use case." (pg. 77)

"The system will have a use case for every goal it accomplishes. If your system just does one single thing, you'll probably only need one use case. If it does ten or fifteen things, then you're going to have a lot of use cases." (pg. 77)

"A use case is what the system does to accomplish a goal. If you write down what the system needs to do to perform a task, you've probably got a use case." (pg. 77)

"The use case isn't very specific. Use cases are meant to help you understand what a system should do- and often to explain the system to others (like the customer or your boss). If your use case focuses on specific code-level details, it's not going to be useful to anyone but a programmer. As a general rule, your use cases should use simple, everyday language. If you're using lots of programming terms, or technical jargon, your use case is probably getting too detailed to be that useful." (pg. 77)

"A use case is not the same as a use case diagram. Use cases are usually a list of steps (although you can write them differently, something we talk about in the Appendix). Use case diagrams are a way to show use cases visually, but we've already been working on our own diagram of how the system works." (pg. 77)

"Turning the use case into actual code is another step in the process of writing your application. The purpose of the use case isn't to detail how you'll write your code. You'll probably still have to do some thinking about how you want to actually put the steps of your use case into action." (pg. 77)

"Use cases do help you write your code- they just aren't specific about programming details. Remember, you'll never write great software if you can't deliver an app that does what the customer wants it to do. Use cases are a tool to help you figure that out- and then you're ready to write code to actually implement the system your use case describes." (pg. 77)

"So far, you've got an initial set of requirements and a good solid use case. But no you need to go back to your requirements and make sure that they'll cover everything your system has to do." (pg. 78)

"Now you need to look over the use case and see if everything the system needs to do is covered by the requirements." (pg. 78)

"A lot of things that happen to a system don't require you to do anything."  (pg. 80)

"The alternate path should have been easy once you figured out the requirements for the main path." (pg. 80)

"Your system must work in the real world so plan and test for when things go wrong." (pg. 85)

"We need to test alternate paths as well as the main path." (pg. 85)

"This part of the diagram is the main path, where everything goes exactly as planned." (pg. 86)

"Remember, this is an alternate path... things don't happen this way every time the system is used. Our system already handled all of these... but we wouldn't know that unless we mapped out this alternate path." (pg. 87)

"Good use cases, requirements, main paths, alternate paths, and a working simulator; we're on the road to great software." (pg. 91)

"External Initiator kicks off the list of steps described in a use case. Without this, a use case never gets going." (pg. 94)

"Use case helps you gather good requirements. It tells a story of how a system works." (pg. 94)

"Start condition is always the first step in the use case." (pg. 94)

"Requirement is something a system has to do to be a success." (pg. 94)

"Clear value, without it, a use case isn't worth anything to anyone. Use cases without this always fail." (pg. 94)

"Stop Condition lets you know when a use case is finished. Without this, use cases can go on forever." (pg. 94)

"Main Path is how a system works when everything is going right. This is usually what customers describe when they're talking about the system." (pg. 94)

"Look closely for the stop condition in this style (paragraph) of use case; it's usually not the last sentence if there are any alternate paths." (pg. 100)

"The clear value of a use case- in most formats isn't stated in the use case, so you'll need to figure it out on your own." (pg. 100)

"The start condition and external initiator are usually both part of the first step of a use case." (pg. 100)

"The stop condition is almost always the last step in the use case." (pg. 100)

"In this use case format (Split), the external initiator is always the primary actor." (pg. 101)

"Any time the goal of a use case is explicitly stated you've got your clear value." (pg. 101)

"Look for the last step in the main path, not the last step of the extension." (pg. 101)

"Be careful! Good use cases make for good requirements, but a bad- or incomplete use case can result in BAD requirements!" (pg. 104)

"Good requirements ensure your system works like your customers expect."

"Make sure your requirements cover all the steps in the use cases for your system."

"Use your use cases to find out about things your customers forgot to tell you."

"Your use cases will reveal any incomplete or missing requirements that you might have to add to your system."

"Requirements are things your system must do to work correctly."
