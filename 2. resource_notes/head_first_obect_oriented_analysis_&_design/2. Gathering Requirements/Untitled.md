" Plan:
1. Gather requirements.
2. Figure out what the system should really do.
3. Get any additional information we need from the customer.
4. Build the system RIGHT!-- We're paying a lot more attention to Step 1 in writing great software this time, aren't we?-- 1. Make sure your software does what the customer wants it to do." (pg. 61)

"A requirements is a specific thing your system has to do to work correctly.-- A requirement is usually a single thing, and you can test that thing to make sure you've actually fulfilled the requirement. 'system' is the complete app or project you're working on. Remember, the customer decides when a system works correctly. So if you leave out a requirement, or even if they forget to mention something to you, the system isn't working correctly!" (pg. 62)

"A requirement is a singular need detailing what a particular product or service should be or do. It is most commonly used in a formal sense in systems engineering or software engineering." (pg. 62)

"When it comes to requirements, the best thing you can do is let the customer talk. And pay attention to what the system needs to do; you can figure out how the system will do those things later."
