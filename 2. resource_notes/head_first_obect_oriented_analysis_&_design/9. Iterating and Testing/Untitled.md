"We used Use Case Diagrams and a key feature list to turn a simple vision statement into an application architecture." (pg. 424)

"Our OO principles help us write well-designed, flexible OO software." (pg. 424)

"You're still writing your software for the customer." (pg. 426)

"None of the tools and techniques matter if you don't use them to produce great software that makes your customer happy." (pg. 426)

"Customers just want the software to work the way that it's supposed to." (pg. 426)

"Iterate deeper means we keep doing analysis and design, but now on each individual part of the system." (pg. 426)

"You write great software iteratively." (pg. 426)

"Work on the big picture, and then iterate over pieces of the app until it's complete." (pg. 426)

"You can choose to focus on specific features of the application. This approach is all about taking on piece of functionality that the customer wants, and working on that functionality until it's complete." (pg. 427)

"Feature Driven Development is when you pick a specific feature in your app, and plan, analyze, and develop that feature to completion." (pg. 427)

"Both approaches to iterating are driven by good requirements." (pg. 427)
 
"Because requirements come from the customer, both approaches focus on delivering what the customer wants." (pg. 427)

"You can also choose to focus on specific flows through the application. This approach takes a complete path through the application, with a clear start and end, and implements that path in your code." (pg. 427)

"Use case driven development is when you pick a scenario through a use case, and write code to support that complete scenario through the use case." (pg. 427)

"You'll often see the terms 'flow' and 'scenario' used interchangeably." (pg. 427)

"When you're using feature driven development, you work on a single feature at a time, and then iterate, knocking off features one at a time until you've finished up the functionality of an application." (pg. 428)

"With feature driven development, you pick a single feature, and the focus is on the feature list of your app." (pg. 428)

"All these other plans and diagrams are used, but your feature list is the focus." (pg. 428)

"With use case driven development, you work on completing a single scenario through a use case. Then you take another scenario and work through it, until all of the use case's scenarios are complete. Then you iterate to the next use case, until all your use cases are working." (pg. 429)

"With use case driven development, you work from the use case diagram, which lists the different use cases in your system." (pg. 429)

"Feature driven development is more granular."

"Use case driven development is more 'big picture'."
