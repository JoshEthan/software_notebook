## Inheritance is when one class inherits behavior from another class.
"Inheritance is when one class inherits behavior from another class, and then change that behavior if needed." (pg. 579)

## superclass is the parent class; subclass is the child; overriding is altering the inherited methods
"super is a special keyword. It refers to the class that this class has inherited behavior from. A subclass can add its own methods to the methods it inherits from its superclass. The subclass can add its own variables to the ones that it inherits. The subclass can change the behavior of its superclass, as well as call the superclass's methods. This is called overriding the superclass's behavior." (pg. 579)

## Inheritance helps us avoid duplicating code
"Inheritance lets you build classes based on other classes, and avoid duplicating and repeating code." (pg. 579)

## Polymorphism lets us use subclasses in place of superclasses
"Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance. When one class inherits from another, then polymorphism allows subclass to stand in for the superclass." (pg. 581)

## superclass foo = superclass OR subclass bar
"On the left side, you have the superclass and on the right, you can have the superclass OR any of its subclasses." (pg. 581)

## Polymorphism code is flexible and easy to change
"You can write code that works on the superclass, but will work with any subclass type. So your code is more flexible. If you need new functionality, you could write a new subclass. But since your code uses the superclass, your new subclass will work without any changes to the rest of our code! That means your code is flexible and can change easily." (pg. 581)

## Inheritance is when a class extends another classes behavior to avoid duplicate code
"Inheritance is when one class extends another class to reuse or build upon the inherited class's behavior." (pg. 586)

## The class being inherited is the superclass; the class inheriting is the subclass
"In inheritance, the class being inherited from is called the superclass: the class that is doing the inheritance is called the subclass." (pg. 586)

## A subclass gets all of the behavior of the superclass
"A subclass gets all the behavior of its superclass automatically." (pg. 586)

## A subclass can override superclass's methods
"A subclass can override its superclass's behavior to change how a method works." (pg. 586)

## Polymorphism is using a subclass in place of a superclass
"Polymorphism is when a subclass "stands in" for its superclass." (pg. 586)

## Polymorphism allows apps to be more flexible.
"Polymorphism allows your applications to be more flexible, and less resistant to change." (pg. 586)
