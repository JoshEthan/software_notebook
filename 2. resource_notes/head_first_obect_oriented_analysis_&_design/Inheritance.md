"That's when one class inherits behavior from another class, and then change that behavior if needed."

"super is a special keyword. It refers to the class that this class has inherited behavior from. A subclass can add its own methods to the methods it inherits from its superclass. The subclass can add its own variables to the ones that it inherits. The subclass can change the behavior of its superclass, as well as call the superclass's methods. This is called overriding the superclass's behavior."

"Inheritance lets you build classes based on other classes, and avoid duplicating and repeating code."

"Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance. When one class inherits from another, then polymorphism allows subclass to stand in for the superclass."

"On the left side, you have the superclass and on the right, you can have the superclass OR any of its subclasses."

"You can write code that works on the superclass, but will work with any subclass type. So your code is more flexible. If you need new functionality, you could write a new subclass. But since your code uses the superclass, your new subclass will work without any changes to the rest of our code! That means your code is flexible and can change easily."
